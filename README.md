# Workable API App
This app hits the 3rd party API from The Movie Database and displays current
movies playing in Greece. The app uses Javascript, HTML/CSS, Handlebars, and the
back-end uses Ruby on Rails with a PSQL database.

### Successes
This app exhibits my first time incorporating a 3rd party API. Having talked to
other students at General Assembly, it was my understanding that using 3rd party
APIs was difficult, however the resources I consulted provided information that
made the devolpment process smooth in this respect.

### Challenges
The biggest challenge I faced was formatting the data from the API. I decided to
use Handlebars.js for this problem. I know that it templates data into HTML and
I have experience with it from past projects. The issue this app faces is requiring
the handlebars script. I left the code I made in this repo to demonstrate my
ability to use the framework but was not able to get the script running at this
time.

### Takeaways
Developing this app provided a great learning experience. I learned how to use
3rd party APIs and access and organize API data. Additionally, throughout this
assignment, I learned how to analyze SQL log files and brushed up on my SQL query
knowledge as well. I hope to take this lesson and apply it to my future developing
experiences, which will hopefully include Workable.
